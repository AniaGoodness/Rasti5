	<h1>Taarlo</h1>
	<h2><i>by Herman de Coninck</i></h2>
		<p>We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br>
And in spring too I feel no different.<br>
We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br>
through much dark-red loss, appellation control√©e,<br>

that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br>
We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br>
Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br>
sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.<br>

33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br>
of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br>
at home in the woods and desolate at home.<br>

<strong>Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br>
The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br>
The here is nowhere, and the now is never.</strong><br>
